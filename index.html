        <p>Hello! I'm Javier Zúñiga Mendoza from Costa Rica, a student passionate about web development and technology.
            I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the WDD 130 course, and I’m truly excited to keep
            improving my
            skills. I love problem-solving, creating meaningful digital experiences, and finding practical ways to make
            technology
            help people in their everyday lives.
            I’m also a proud family man — I’ve been married for 15 years and have two wonderful children: a 10-year-old
            boy and a
            14-year-old girl who inspire me every day.
            Outside of coding, I enjoy playing soccer, spending time with my family, and constantly looking for ways to
            make life
            easier for others.
            Learning programming has become a passion because it allows me to solve problems, be creative, and help
            people by
            building useful solutions.</p>

        <h2>San Jose - Costa Rica</h2>
        <img src="images/san-jose-costa-rica2.jpg" alt="City of San Jose, Costa Rica" width="200">
        <p>Costa Rica is a tropical country in Central America, with a population of approximately 5 million people. It
            is bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the south, the Caribbean Sea to the northeast, and the
            Pacific Ocean to the southwest. The country has two main seasons, a dry season (December to April) and a
            rainy season (May to November), although the climate varies greatly by altitude and proximity to the oceans.
            Its highlights include its great biodiversity, more than 25% of its territory protected in national parks,
            and its tropical climate that ranges from temperate and cloudy in the highlands to warm and humid on the
            coasts. Costa Ricans call themselves "Ticos" (males) or "Ticas" (females). Also a unique word that describes
            Costa Ricans is, "Pura Vida".</p>
