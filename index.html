        <p>Hello! I'm Javier Zuniga Mendoza from Costa Rica, a student passionate about web development and
            technology.
            I'm excited to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through this WDD 130 course. I enjoy problem-solving and
            creating meaningful
            digital experiences. I also like to play soccer and hang out with my family.</p>

        <p>Costa Rica is a tropical country in Central America, with a population of approximately 5 million people. It
            is bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the south, the Caribbean Sea to the northeast, and the
            Pacific Ocean to the southwest. The country has two main seasons, a dry season (December to April) and a
            rainy season (May to November), although the climate varies greatly by altitude and proximity to the oceans.
            Its highlights include its great biodiversity, more than 25% of its territory protected in national parks,
            and its tropical climate that ranges from temperate and cloudy in the highlands to warm and humid on the
            coasts. Costa Ricans call themselves "Ticos" (males) or "Ticas" (females). Also a unique word that describes
            Costa Ricans is, "Pura Vida".</p>
